# Archive Directory

This directory contains historical workflow and status documents from KnowledgeBeast's autonomous development phases (Weeks 1 & 2).

## Purpose

These documents represent milestone reports, code reviews, and workflow planning materials that were created during the initial autonomous agent development cycles. They have been archived to:

- Keep the project root clean and focused on current documentation
- Preserve historical context and development decisions
- Document the evolution of the codebase and testing infrastructure
