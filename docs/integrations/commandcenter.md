# CommandCenter Integration

Integrate KnowledgeBeast with Performia CommandCenter.

## Overview

KnowledgeBeast was originally developed for Performia's command and control system.

## Integration Points

1. **Voice Commands**: Process natural language queries
2. **Documentation Search**: Search internal docs and manuals
3. **Session Context**: Maintain conversation context
4. **Real-time Updates**: Stream search results

## Example Integration

```python
from knowledgebeast import KnowledgeBeast

class CommandCenterKB:
    def __init__(self):
        self.kb = KnowledgeBeast()

    def handle_voice_query(self, query: str):
        results = self.kb.query(query, n_results=3)
        return self._format_for_voice(results)

    def _format_for_voice(self, results):
        # Format for voice output
        return [r['text'][:200] for r in results]
```

For full CommandCenter integration, see the Performia repository.
