# KnowledgeBeast - Autonomous Agent Workflow Plan

## Overview

This plan coordinates **8 autonomous agents** working in parallel using git worktrees to implement all improvements from the comprehensive review. Each agent operates independently, creates PRs, runs reviews until 10/10, and merges upon success.

## Agent Autonomous Workflow

### Each Agent Will:

1. **Setup Phase:**
   ```bash
   # Create worktree and branch
   git worktree add ../KnowledgeBeast-worktrees/<name> -b <branch-name>
   cd ../KnowledgeBeast-worktrees/<name>
   ```

2. **Development Phase:**
   - Implement all assigned tasks
   - Run tests continuously: `pytest -v`
   - Run linters: `make lint`
   - Fix issues until clean

3. **Quality Phase:**
   - Run full test suite: `make test`
   - Check coverage: `pytest --cov=knowledgebeast --cov-report=term`
   - Run security checks: `bandit -r knowledgebeast/`
   - Run type checks: `mypy knowledgebeast/`

4. **PR Creation Phase:**
   ```bash
   # Commit changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "<type>: <description>

   <detailed changes>

   - Task 1 completed
   - Task 2 completed
   ...

   ðŸ¤– Generated with Claude Code Agent
   Co-Authored-By: Claude Agent <noreply@anthropic.com>"

   # Push branch
   git push -u origin <branch-name>

   # Create PR using gh CLI
   gh pr create --title "<title>" --body "<body>" --base main
   ```

5. **Review Cycle Phase:**
   - Run `/review` on the PR
   - Fix any issues identified
   - Re-run `/review` until 10/10
   - Request human approval if needed

6. **Merge Phase:**
   ```bash
   # Once approved and 10/10
   gh pr merge <pr-number> --squash --delete-branch
   ```

7. **Cleanup Phase:**
   ```bash
   # Remove worktree
   cd ../../KnowledgeBeast
   git worktree remove ../KnowledgeBeast-worktrees/<name>
   ```

Time 0:00  â†’  Agent 2: Security CORS (3h)
Time 0:00  â†’  Agent 3: Thread Locks (6h)
Time 0:00  â†’  Agent 4: Async Fixes (4h)

Expected: All 4 PRs created and reviewed within 6 hours
```

### Batch 2 (Start After Batch 1 Merges)
**Agents 5, 6 run in parallel**

```
Time 6:00  â†’  Agent 5: Security Tests (8h)
Time 6:00  â†’  Agent 6: Concurrency Tests (8h)

Expected: Both PRs created and reviewed within 8 hours
```

### Batch 3 (Start After Batch 2 Merges)
**Agents 7, 8 run in parallel**

```
Time 14:00 â†’  Agent 7: Architecture (12h)
Time 14:00 â†’  Agent 8: Documentation (6h)

Expected: Both PRs created and reviewed within 12 hours
```

### Total Timeline
- **Batch 1:** 0-6 hours (4 PRs)
- **Batch 2:** 6-14 hours (2 PRs)
- **Batch 3:** 14-26 hours (2 PRs)
- **Total:** ~26 hours elapsed, ~60 hours of work done

**Parallelization Efficiency:** ~2.3x speedup

---

## Success Metrics

### Per-Agent Metrics
- Code quality: Must pass all linters
- Test coverage: Must meet or exceed targets
- Review score: Must achieve 10/10
- Merge status: Auto-merge on success

### Overall Project Metrics
- **8 PRs created and merged**
- **Security score: A** (no critical vulnerabilities)
- **Performance: 8-12x improvement** verified
- **Test coverage: >85%** verified
- **All critical issues resolved**

---

## Agent Coordination Protocol

### Communication
- Each agent logs progress to `logs/agent-<name>.log`
- Status updates posted to GitHub PR comments
- Coordinator monitors all agent logs

### Conflict Resolution
- Agents work on independent modules (minimal conflicts)
- If conflict detected, later agent rebases on main
- Human intervention only for complex conflicts

### Failure Handling
- Agent retries failed tasks up to 3 times
- If still failing, escalates to human review
- Other agents continue independently

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass
- Coverage must not decrease
- Linters must pass clean
- Security scan must pass
- Performance benchmarks must improve or maintain

---

## Setup Commands

### Initialize Worktrees Directory
```bash
cd /Users/danielconnolly/Projects/KnowledgeBeast
mkdir -p ../KnowledgeBeast-worktrees
mkdir -p logs
```

### Create All Worktrees (for manual testing)
```bash
# Batch 1
git worktree add ../KnowledgeBeast-worktrees/security-auth -b fix/security-authentication
git worktree add ../KnowledgeBeast-worktrees/security-cors -b fix/security-cors-config
git worktree add ../KnowledgeBeast-worktrees/performance-locks -b perf/thread-lock-optimization
git worktree add ../KnowledgeBeast-worktrees/performance-async -b perf/async-sync-fixes

# Batch 2 (create after batch 1 merges)
git worktree add ../KnowledgeBeast-worktrees/testing-security -b test/security-suite
git worktree add ../KnowledgeBeast-worktrees/testing-concurrency -b test/concurrency-suite

# Batch 3 (create after batch 2 merges)
git worktree add ../KnowledgeBeast-worktrees/architecture-refactor -b refactor/decompose-god-object
git worktree add ../KnowledgeBeast-worktrees/docs-enhancement -b docs/troubleshooting-guide
```

### Cleanup All Worktrees
```bash
git worktree remove ../KnowledgeBeast-worktrees/security-auth
git worktree remove ../KnowledgeBeast-worktrees/security-cors
git worktree remove ../KnowledgeBeast-worktrees/performance-locks
git worktree remove ../KnowledgeBeast-worktrees/performance-async
git worktree remove ../KnowledgeBeast-worktrees/testing-security
git worktree remove ../KnowledgeBeast-worktrees/testing-concurrency
git worktree remove ../KnowledgeBeast-worktrees/architecture-refactor
git worktree remove ../KnowledgeBeast-worktrees/docs-enhancement
```

---

## Ready to Launch

All agents are configured and ready to launch. Execute the following command to start:

```bash
# This will be triggered by the agent launcher
./launch-agents.sh --batch 1
```

The coordinator will monitor progress and automatically launch subsequent batches upon successful completion of dependencies.
